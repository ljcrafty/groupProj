		<h2>What are Regular Expressions?</h2>
		<p>
			A regular expression is a sequence of characters that outlines the way a program 
			will search through a body of text for a specific pattern of characters.
		</p>
		
		<h2>What languages use Regular Expressions?</h2>
		<p>
			Languages that utilize regular expressions include JavaScript, Java, Ruby, C#, 
			PHP, Perl, Python, C++, and others.
		</p>
	
		<h2>Why should I use Regular Expressions?</h2>
		<p>
			Regular expressions, while complicated to learn at first, are very helpful in the 
			long run. One regular expression can replace ten lines of code if done correctly. 
			There are many different situations in which they can be used and the syntax is 
			nearly identical in every language they are used in. So, once you learn them 
			once, you know them in every situation.
		</p>
		
		<h2>What are some examples of times I would need Regular Expressions?</h2>
		<p>
			Regular expressions can be used in a variety of situations. If you are scraping 
			data from a webpage, regular expressions can help you extract only the right 
			data. If you are evaluating data a user input for things like a phone number or 
			email, regular expressions will allow you to automate that process. If you want to 
			transfer data from a text document to a database, regular expressions will divide 
			up the data easily. These are just a few scenarios in which regular expressions 
			are not only useful, but the superior way to complete a task.
